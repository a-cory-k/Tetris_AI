## 🚀 Overview
This project is an experimental framework for developing and evaluating AI agents that play **Tetris**. The goal is to compare different learning strategies—such as **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**, **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**, **LSTM-based actors** (in process),**Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** (in process), and **heuristic-based methods**—in terms of performance, stability, and learning efficiency.

The project is actively under development and serves as a research environment for reinforcement learning, neural architectures, and dataset-driven policy optimization.

## 🛠 Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/a-cory-k/Tetris_AI.git
cd Tetris_AI
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# ▶️ Usage
Run the main script:
```
python main.py
```
After starting, a **main menu** will appear. You can choose one of the following modes:

| Mode | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| 🎮 **Player vs Player (PVP)** | Compete against a friend on the same computer. | Both players control their own tetrominoes. |
| 🤖 **Player vs Bot (PVB)** | Play against an AI agent. | You can select which bot to compete against (CNN, DQN, or Heuristic). |
| ⚔️ **Bot vs Bot (BVB)** | Watch two AI agents play against each other. | Useful for testing AI strategies and comparing performance. |
| 🕹️ **Single Player (SP)** | Play alone or watch a single AI agent play. | Choose a bot to observe its gameplay, or play manually yourself. |
